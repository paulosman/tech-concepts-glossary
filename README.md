# Tech Jargon Glossary

The goal of this project is to create an accessible glossary of terms, practices and tools in software that might be confusing to people unfamiliar with them. 

Every industry has jargon, and sometimes it's difficult to remember that something isn't universally understood. Hopefully this glossary is helpful! 

Contributions are welcome, either in the form of content or suggestions for topics. This is intended to be living collection of documents and an ever evolving project.

## Table of Contents

- Bitmasks (In Progress)
- Circuit Breaking (In Progress)
- Database Sharding (In Progress)
- Exponential Backoff (In Progress)
- Load Balancing (In Progress)
